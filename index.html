                    This is the story all about how my life got busier and more difficult because I decided to join a
                    bootcamp. I'm tired more often, excited to be learning all new things every single day, and I want to continue on this journey to becoming a full stack developer. If there's anymore content that I can fill in about my life I'll do it soon. Maybe.
                    <br><br>
                    I grew up in New Jersey around the Washington Township area up until the 4th grade, and then moved to Minnesota for a couple years. I've dabbled in coding ever since I got my first computer, but never truly stuck with any one language. The way of the web is the future, and I want to take my learnings here and use them to get a job doing something I absolutely love.
